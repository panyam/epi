This is a collection of solutions for most of the problems (and counting) in the Elements 
of Programming Interviews book in Haskell.

Why Haskell?  Because I've always liked it and wanted to get back into it and while it is 
simple enough to do things I Haskell, doing so in a way that guarantees algorithmic 
complexities is tricky and I wanted this to be an exercise in that as well.
